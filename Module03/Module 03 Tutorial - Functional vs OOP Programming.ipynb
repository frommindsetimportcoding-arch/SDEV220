    "The code I provide below was my attempt at solving this problem without relying on the qsort function. The difficulty is in ensuring that is is truly a one-pass algorithm. This program works if the user is aware of the constraints. In this case, I know that I am only dealing with 0s, 1s, and 2s. There may be other methods for using a similar function on larger sets with unkown constraints, but research has shown that using list comprehension comparing to an item in the list is the more effecient method of sorting a list of unknown constraints.

I also had the len(arr) check right before the comprehension run. This is no bueno, I think, if you happen to have an empty list for one of your partitional lists. It returns an index error. I also, started off by setting left, center, right to equal empty lists. Let me check real quick, but I think that this would reset my lists where I had them and end up with a recursion error or maybe an index error depending on where it was located. Nope, I debugged everywhere that I could have half-logically placed the expression and the program still works like a champ. COOL. But I don't need it there, so that expression doesn't get picked up for the recess basketball game. "

    "A true binary search uses the divide and conqure technique. So, I went this route. Couple issues that I ran into. **list_length** moves faster than the **len(lst)**. It was working to keep track of my index when I sliced the list and eliminated the left list. **remember_index += list_length** is original code. It took me quite a bit to realize that how I could use **len(lst)** to determine if the entire list had been searched and to avoid an infinite loop when searching for something not in the list. In the beginning I had a simpler list and just tried to search beyond this list and found this issue. Once I realized that I needed to return the first occurence of an index, it kind of negated my original *while k != i*. So, I had to revamp the original code a bit and the if, elif, else structure got moved around a little too. \n",
