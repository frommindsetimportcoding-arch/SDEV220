Advancing Python Studies

The intent is to become familiar with navigating the github environment as well as utilizing git. I have been playing alot with the gitbash terminal. 
- I am trying to understand how exactly the branches work. There was an area of github where i was unable to reach the main branch (which i had attempted to delete using gitbash).
  * Yet I can see that there are still two branches. Master and main.
- Main branch was originally the default branch but I wanted the default branch to be named Master. However, I must have created a second branch by accident and named it master.
- I figured out how to switch the default to the master and I merged the branches so that master has all of the files that were provided with git init. I had to use --allow-unrelated-histories flag to merge branches. (safety feature).
- During this process i figured eh, why not keep the main branch as a testing grounds branch to practice pull requests and merging commits to the master branch.
  * That's when I noticed that there are areas that claim the main branch does not exist.
  * Try and figure out why!
